<p>I don’t know if I could spoil <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59151.Chess_Story" target="_blank">Chess Story (Stefan Zweig, 1942)</a> even if I tried. The book isn’t so much a story as an exploration of madness and a couple of the ways that madness manifests itself. The story is about a man who gets captured and put into solitary confinement by the Nazis. The narrator is an unnamed man to whom this former captive, Dr. D, tells his story.</p><p>The doctor first experiences the madness of sameness. He describes what it’s like to have no stimulation (aside from occasional interrogation sessions). Zweig does a fantastic job conveying the sense of oppression and dread that Dr. D's room tortures him with. The same furniture. The same wallpaper. The window that looks on a firewall (a window that doesn't have a view, how cruel). No way to tell the time. Nothing but the thoughts in his head. Day after day after day. The horror of Dr. D's situation is convincing and terrifying. In an environment where there's absolutely nothing to distract him, ever, the doctor's thoughts spiral out of his control. He can't silence his thoughts. He can barely control them. He's at the mercy of his mind, a mind that has lost all sense of time and presence, a mind that can't be stilled.</p><p>The second madness comes upon Dr. D after he steals a book from an officer's coat. The book is a collection of famous chess games, the pieces’ moves in chess notation, and it's a life raft for the doctor's drowning sanity. He finally has something to do, something to focus on. He learns to read the notation and is soon able to picture the games in his head as he reads the games. Eventually, he learns the games by heart and starts to intuit the strategies behind them. And soon he gets bored. There's no more novelty or joy in playing games in his head, games he's envisioned hundreds of times before. So the doctor starts to play games in his head, Dr. D verses Dr. D. He has to essentially split his mind in two, switching back and forth between two "players", each of which don't know the plans of the other. The joy he gets out of this ramps up to maniacal levels. Just how he couldn't stop his racing thoughts when he had nothing to do, now that he has two people in his head who keep challenging each other to chess matches he can't stop those either—nor does he wish to stop. Eventually he's living completely in his head, arguing with himself, laying traps for himself, challenging himself over and over because neither player wants to give up.</p><p>Under stimulation and overstimulation. We get too little of the latter and too much of the former these days, and looking up from my phone after spending an hour on Reddit when I only meant to spend five minutes seems to me too much like Dr. D's chess-mania for me not to be cautioned by his tale.</p><p>(I read the Kindle version of Joel Rotenberg's translation.)</p>
