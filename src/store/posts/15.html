<p>The plot of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49015373-revelation-space" target="_blank">Revelation Space (Alastair Reynolds, 2000)</a> is like a jigsaw puzzle... with pieces missing. But it's worth going through the effort of putting the pieces together. Once you do that, you're in for a wild sci-fi ride, full of interesting concepts and a story of galactic proportions.</p><p>It took me a long time to figure out the plot and how each person and idea and historical tidbit fit into place. I got annoyed at the rough dialogue and how sometimes characters would learn something groundbreaking but the reader wouldn't find out until way later what that information was. It got hard to keep track of what puzzle pieces I was still missing and if I was remembering something verifiably true or some lie one character told another.</p><p>BUT I think the good outweighs the bad in this book. The ideas are AWESOME in scale and ingenuity. Reynolds has an incredible imagination. And as someone who's currently reading the second book in the series, I have to say that I don't mind the convoluted nature of the first book now that this second book has a clear plot line. Going through the confusion of the first book feels like it's paying off, like a challenge that I had to go through in order to reap the rewards of an even more exciting and well-written second book.</p><p>score for RS on its own: 3/5</p><p>score if you also read the second book: 4/5</p>
