<p><a href=“https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17470669-i-robot” target=“_blank”>I, Robot</a> is a collection of short stories by Issac Assimov that were originally published between 1940 and 1950, when Assimov was 20-30 years old. For the time they were written in and considering what a young writer Assimov was at the time, it’s a truly amazing piece of fiction. But I’m not telling you to read a book just because it was good for some certain place or time. I want to tell you whether I, Robot is worth reading <i>today</i>. So here’s my attempt:</p><p>Are the stories interesting? Yes. Do they link together in a satisfying way? Absolutely. Does the escalation of the robots' sophistication in each story keep the momentum going through to the end of the book? Definitely. Did the world-building hold up over the 71 years since it was published? Nope. No. Not at all.</p><p>The dialogue is archaic and instantly put in my mind images of guys in slacks and old-fashion ties and women in knee-length dresses with their hair up. (Audio recordings on TAPE?!) The robots are described in a way that I can only call clunky, like how a child might draw a robot. Now, I'm not for one second blaming Assimov for any of this. How could he have imagined how 2021 would actually look? And in a way, the 50s vibe almost adds to the stories. The 50s in America with robots in it is actually kind of cool. Whether Assimov meant to or not, he did build a world for his readers, a world that never existed and never will but a world that is well-realized nonetheless. If you can get past imaging old cars and old-fashioned glasses and clunky spacesuits then you're in for a fascinating and brilliant collection of stories. In my opinion, the clunkiness of the world-building is far outweighed by the brilliance of the stories.</p><p>Some people think Assimov wrote the robot series as an exploration of how to make robots possible and what they would do for us if/when they became sufficiently advanced. But I disagree. Assimov paints a grim picture of a world where technology never does what we expect it to. His famous “three laws of robotics” don’t protect humanity, and he wasn’t trying to prove that they would. Instead, he was showing us that maybe humans can’t write a set of laws that would distill their technological creations down to a predictable set of actions. We can’t trust ourselves to plug each and every loophole, and we can’t even trust that everyone will even want to plug the loopholes. (Imagine a robot army that doesn’t have to abide by the rule “don’t harm humans”. Some people would certainly consider that valuable.)</p><p>Technology, despite what we might think, is not in our control. We can’t control what gets invented or how the inventions are used. We can’t control who uses what and to what end. And as technology continues beyond the reach of our minds to fully understand, we’re starting to lose our ability to predict what it will do.</p>
