<p><a href=“https://www.goodreads.com/series/192752-bobiverse” target=“_blank”>Bobiverse</a> is a series about a guy (named Bob) who, before dying in a car accident, gets his brain backed up digitally in case sometime in the future someone could revive him as an AI. Well, it turns out someone could, and now Bob is a virtual person, living on a spaceship, and he can go anywhere he wants to, he is immortal, and given enough time he can command his drones to build pretty much anything. Bob can even make clones of himself, each slightly different from the others, to help him with his adventure. The series is light-hearted, easy-to-read, fun sci-fi. Modern sci-fi at its best.</p><p>I had very different experiences with each of the Bobiverse books, and I’m sure if I read them again I’d have different experiences again. So the rest of this post is mostly about how the time and place and mindset while reading a book can radically change how enjoyable it is.</p><p>I listened to the first book, We Are Legion (We Are Bob), as an audiobook during a road trip with my best friends one summer. I did most of the driving, so while the others took naps, I listened to Bob’s story. I have great memories from that time, but I do remember trying to rush to the end of the book. I think I got a bit bored by the end, and I was also on vacation and was probably trying to get it done before going to the arcade or buying fudge or something. I liked the book, but I think I like it even more looking back and recalling it.</p><p>Book two I picked up because... I don’t remember why. It certainly wasn’t because I’d loved the first all that much, and I ended up liking the second much less. I read this one on Kindle, and I remember barely any of the story. All I remember is that I couldn’t wait to get to the end of the book. I was bored and frustrated that I couldn’t keep the Bobs’ names and storylines straight in my head.</p><p>I took a long break between the second and third books, but eventually I started to miss the casual, low-stakes (I mean, they’re literally immortal) vibe of the books. Somehow, Bobiverse had crept up on me and become my sci-fi comfort reading. I kept thinking about the stories and concepts until I was compelled to pick up the third book. I ended up loving this one the most. (It also has the coolest cover, imo.) Sure, the stories and names were sometimes hard to keep track of, and it’s hard to get emotionally involved when the characters live forever and can pretty much make and do anything at anytime because they live in a virtual world and command millions of drones in the physical world, but book three finally felt like the book where things got real. Real people got involved in the Bobs’ lives, there was a full-on war, the Bobs could interact with the real world by inhabiting realistic-looking androids... The Bobiverse was finally worth my time and total attention. I can’t wait to get into the fourth book.</p>
