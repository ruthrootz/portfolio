<p>I was barely a few chapters into <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1234311.The_Shadow_of_the_Torturer" target="_blank">The Shadow of the Torturer (Gene Wolfe, 1980)</a> when I knew I’d found a new favorite book and series. Now that I’ve finished the series, I can say my assumption was correct. But not for the reasons that other books are my favorites. Some of my other favorite books include Project Hail Mary, Ubik, The Book Thief and Name of the Wind. I love those books because of their humor and/or the characters and/or the exciting plot. The Book of the New Sun has those things, but they’re buried under layers and layers of world-building and hidden meanings. And that’s why this series is hailed as brilliant but also difficult to read.</p><p>Gene Wolfe isn’t like other writers. Gene Wolfe is an absolute master. He doesn’t hold the reader by the hand and tell them what’s happening. He’s built a complex world, Urth (Earth, but millennia in the future), with evolved languages, a shadowed past, a vastly different society and culture than ours. He tells nothing and shows everything. He shows the world to us through the words of someone who is writing to the people of his time. His name is Severian, and he’s a torturer and executioner, writing a memoir, what we know of as the Book of the New Sun. Severian sometimes explains things, but not anything that he assumes a person living on Urth would already know. That’s, for me, the magic of this book. I’m transported to Urth, and I have to figure out what’s going on, piece together clues, as I follow Severian the Torturer’s story.</p><p>It’s like a puzzle. The plot is relatively straightforward in the first book (which is an absolute joke as you go on through the series), but the world and the main character are fractally complex. Every other sentence is a shocking little piece to add to my slowly-growing collection of knowledge about Urth and its strange characters and lore.</p><p>Random examples of the sorts of hints Wolfe drops about the world: Rats maybe have developed their own written language?? There’s a picture (I think photo) of the first moon landing?? The buildings are actually spaceships?! The little tidbits Gene drops are like puzzles to figure out.</p><br /><p><span class="bold-text">Here are the things I’ve done to make my first read through of the first Books of the New Sun entry an absolute blast...</span></p><p><a href=“https://www.alzabosoup.com/“ target=“_blank”>Alzabo Soup</a> - This podcast and the guys who make it are amazing. I listened to all the episodes for Shadow and then only a few of the episodes for the other books. I’d read a chapter, excited to listen to the corresponding episode, and I’d listen to the podcast, excited to read the next chapter. Virtuous cycle!</p><p><span class="bold-text">join a cult</span> - <a href=“https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChWX1yxVym2kNXMBD1oKo8Q” target=“_blank”>Media Death Cult</a> is a sci-fi community based around the YouTube channel (by the same name). Having a bunch of dorks to talk to along my reading journey was incredibly rewarding and motivating.</p><p><a href=“https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5970607-lexicon-urthus” target=“_blank”>Lexicon Urthus</a> - This is a dictionary for the world of Urth, created by Michael Andre-Driussi. Definitely not a required companion while reading BotNS, but I found it fun to use.</p><p><span class="bold-text">enjoy the journey</span> - This series is a puzzle and probably unlike any other series you’ve ever read or ever will. Embrace it.</p><p><span class="bold-text">do it again</span> - Last but not least, when you recover from the first read-through, reread it! You’ll be reading an entirely different series, I promise.</p>
