<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game" target="_blank">Ender’s Game </a>is so many people’s absolute favorite book, and for good reason. It’s well-written, well-paced and has something for every age of reader. As a kind you might gravitate to the action and the cool zero-gravity games. As a teen you might relate more to Ender’s struggles with his family and with growing up and having new responsibilities thrust on him. And as an adult you’re probably going to find the psychological and ethical angles of the book most fascinating. This is why Ender’s Game is one of the very few books the I’ve reread.</p><p>Ender’s Game follows Ender, a little boy from Earth who gets sent to a Battle School, a school in space where kids barely study regular subjects and instead devote their time to a sport that’s played in a giant, zero-gravity room. Two armies of children armed with laser guns battle each other for points, prestige and the skills necessary to move on to Command School where they’re trained to command fleets of space ships, all in preparation for the next alien invasion. Earth was almost destroyed the first time the aliens came, and the humans don’t want to see that disaster happen again.</p><p>Ender’s Game is a very digestible sci-fi novel, even if you’re not a fan of the genre. It has action, memorable characters, heart-warming relationships and a main character who is frighteningly, fascinatingly brilliant. I love reading stories from the perspective of someone way smarter than me, and I’m always impressed by the authors who can pull off smart characters.</p>
