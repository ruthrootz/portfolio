<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/216363.The_Man_in_the_High_Castle" target="_blank">The Man in the High Castle</a> is the most "normal" PKD book I've read so far. It's an alternate history where Japan and German won WWII and they've split up the US, Japan getting the west and Germany getting the east. There's a strip of land in between that is still the US, but at no point was any sort of official government mentioned, so the "US" is more like no-man's land at this point. The societal structure of the former Western US is drastically different. The Japanese are the ruling class, white people are the second-rate labor class, and black people have been relegated to a slave class. It's a horrifying picture, but at the same time the characters in the story are so entrenched in their world that they don't have the perspective that the reader has. For them, it's all normal, and that made the reading experience interesting because I was horrified at the same time that I was in the head of someone who was usually totally unperturbed.</p><p>I enjoyed this book. Most definitely. But I'm not sure why. Is there a plot? Kind of. A little bit. Not really. The story follows several different people: an American antiques dealer, a Japanese government official, a Swiss businessman from Germany, an undercover Jewish metal worker, the Jew's ex-wife who is living in Colorado... Some of their story-lines intersect, some don't. Some of the story-lines end up being relevant to the end of the book, but some don't. Are the characters interesting? For sure. They're each very different and have a different view of their world, and by following them I slowly got a picture of what this alternate history world was like. It was like a puzzle, to put together the different bits of information into an omniscient whole.</p><p>In short, the world building is great, the characters are interesting, and it was fun to figure out how the plot lines were related and to figure out the social dynamics of the world. And now on to my complaints/rant. Be ye warned, if you read on, you'll get spoilers...</p><p>Okay. That ending? Cool as heck. Mind-blowing. I'll be thinking about it for a long time. Essentially, the Oracle claims that the alternate reality in the Grasshopper book is true, which could mean so many different things. Is the world a simulation? The Oracle is the AI controlling the simulation, and the world of the Grasshopper is the "real" world? My theory is the jewelry, the jewelry that Paul said had "wu", is similar to the Oracle in that it's a power that lies between the yin and the yang, on the line of the natural course of the world. The yin is the world of the book, the dark side, and the yang is the Grasshopper side. Somehow the world got split into two, and the Oracle is left bridging the gap. Because the jewelry had this wu, it allowed Tagomi to glimpse the other side, the other world. But obviously, I have no idea what I'm talking about, and my head is still spinning from finishing the book last night.</p><p>One complaint: I loved the mystery we're left with at the very end of the book, but it annoys me to no end that it turns out all of the rest of the story, all the intersecting plot lines, all of that means nothing?? The entire point of the book was to drop this bomb on us at the very very end? So essentially, the entire book could be shortened to a few pages of world-building and then the ending twist?? Obviously, I get that that would make for a horrible story, but I feel kind of cheated that most of the book seems pointless once the Oracle tells us that the Grasshopper is true. But I guess that might be a point PKD is making. The twist ending in all our lives is death, when the world vanishes and ceases to have meaning.</p>
