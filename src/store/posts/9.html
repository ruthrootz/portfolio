<p>Even if it isn't always obvious, Philip K. Dick's books tend to be very theme-oriented, rather than character or plot driven, at least the few I've read. The theme can be hidden under layers and layers of words, and it might take digging to get to it, but for me personally, getting to the theme is the ultimate goal of reading a PKD novel. The characters might be flat, the plot might be simplistic or boring or nearly nonexistent (yes, you, The Man in the High Castle), but once I latch onto a theme or idea that makes me think, I'm happy. Making the reader think is the point of sci-fi for me.</p><p>And <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22590.Ubik" target="_blank">Ubik</a> is an awesome sci-fi book. There are many diverse characters, but they're not very three-dimensional. There's a plot that's surprisingly easy to follow, but it's not very interesting to me. The world is well developed, but I abhorred the multitudes of outfit descriptions. (I really didn't like having to read about another person's ridiculous, "futuristic" outfit. But I guess it helped to make the world more memorable?) But the redeeming feature of this story is the theme, the idea of entropy. Human life is a constant battle against entropy. We build our lives out of messy, raw materials. We do our best to cure ourselves from sickness and aging. We fight against our base, animal natures in order to build as civilized a society as we can manage. This story takes the idea of fighting entropy and time to the next level.</p><p>The world of Ubik is a future in which nearly every appliance only works if you put money into it (toasters, showers and even front doors) and where humans have evolved various psychic and anti-psychic abilities. There are two rival organizations, one organization that hires psychics and one that hires anti-psychics, and people hire these organizations to essentially protect themselves from these powers (mind-reading, future-telling, etc.). I'm not going to go into the plot other than to say that it kept me hooked the whole time. It was interesting and easy to follow. I kept comparing it to Neuromancer while reading. Ubik has a similarly fast-paced plot, but it's actually intelligible, unlike Neuromancer.</p><p>I loved Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? for the world-building and atmosphere. The feeling of gloom and dirt and despair is palpable thanks to the visual nature of the writing. Ubik is far less emotive, but it's way more fun. If you're not going to read much PKD, then I at least think you should read these two very different but very worth-it short sci-fi novels, DADOES and Ubik.</p>
