<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary" target="_blank">Project Hail Mary (Andy Weir, 2021)</a> is amazing. Definitely in my top five sci-fi books of all time. The characters are realistic and interesting and hilarious. The plot is fascinating. The science is super well explained, and I think I learned more from this novel than from most of the science classes I’ve taken. The parts of the story where the characters have a specific problem to solve were engaging and made me feel like I was involved in the process. You should read this book if you have even a little bit of interest in science.</p><p>Here is the premise: Dr. Grace wakes up alone on a spaceship. He has no idea where he is or who he is, not even his name. Slowly, his memory starts to return in flashbacks as he explores the spaceship and learns more about himself and the nightmare world he’s woken up in. Back in our solar system, the Sun is dying. Strange little specks of something are sucking all the energy out of the Sun, and the Earth is about to enter an ice age. In less than half a century half of the human race will be dead, and it will only go downhill from there. Dr. Grace’s job is to figure out what the specks are and how to get rid of them. As the reader, you get to piece together the truth along with Dr. Grace, as the full picture of what’s happening, what the stakes are and who Dr. Grace is starts to come together.</p><p>I’m not going to spoil any of the plot of Project Hail Mary in this review, but I will spoil how the book will make you feel. If you want to go into the book knowing nothing other than that it’s incredible and worth reading, stop here.</p><p>My favorite part of reading this novel, by far, is how happy it made me feel. I felt like I was involved in the same mission Dr. Grace was on, trying to solve the same mysteries and problems. I was on a wild, fun, scary space mission! I loved Dr. Grace, not despite but because of his faults and endless supply of brain farts. I loved all his side-kick characters—truly cared about them. (There's one in particular who is even better than Dr. Grace. You'll know them when you meet them.) I don’t remember the last time I felt so excited and happy to be reading. And that’s the highest praise I can give any book.</p>
