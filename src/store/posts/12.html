<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59924.The_Lathe_of_Heaven" target=“_blank”>The Lathe of Heaven</a> by Ursula K. Le Guin is a story about a man, George Orr, whose dreams come true—not his aspirations but the dreams he dreams while sleeping. The problem is, he can’t control his dreams. For example, one morning as a teenager he wakes up to find out that his aunt had died in a car accident, just like it happened in his dream. The people around him don’t think anything has changed, for them the world has always been the one in which his aunt died in a car crash, but Orr can remember both timelines, the one before he dreamt and the altered one after he dreamt.</p><p>Orr goes to a psychiatrist, Dr. Haber, to get help for his condition. He’s terrified of sleeping, for fear of how his dreams will alter the world. But instead of helping Orr, Dr. Haber realizes the potential of Orr’s abilities and begins to use their weekly appointments to hypnotize Orr and tell him what to dream. The doctor tries to create a better reality with this powerful, one-of-a-kind tool he’s found: George Orr. This tool can fight against entropy, which makes it a tool for creating and maintaining life, and, he claims, that is a good thing. But Orr points out: "We’re in the world, not against it. It doesn’t work to try to stand outside things and run them that way, it just doesn’t work. It goes against life. There is a way, but you have to follow it. The world is, no matter how we think it ought to be. You have to be with it. You have to let it be.”</p><p>That’s what makes life precious, our inability to control or predict it. If we could control everything, could create or destroy at our every whim, then life would be just as worthless and expendable as a snowflake in the middle of Antarctica. Each week, Orr comes to see the doctor, and the doctor makes Orr dream of a better world—or does he? Even with his sophisticated machines that can record dreams and trigger certain brain wave patterns, Dr. Haber can’t completely control what Orr dreams. This is where the story gets exciting and where I’ll stop my summary. Le Guin is a master of making the absurd realistic. Her characters are life-like and unforgettably unique. I found The Lathe of Heaven far superior to The Left Hand of Darkness, and I wish Lathe was more popular because I think a lot of people would agree with me.</p>
