<p>I have bad luck with third books in series. Lately, there haven't been many thirds (hehe, get the reference?) that I've enjoyed. I thought <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/89184.Absolution_Gap" target="_blank">Absolution Gap (Alastair Reynolds, 2003)</a> would break that trend. I thought. Right up until the very end, I thought.</p><p>First the good stuff! The characters were much more interesting in this book. I actually cared for them, and even the times when they did despicable things I was still on board. The dialogue was good, and there were even some emotional scenes, like the one where Khouri and Scorpio talk after saving Aura. (“Clavain would love her and that’s good enough for me.”) Scorpio is probably the most interesting character. He's flawed and sometimes horrible, but he's loyal and smart and did his darndest to battle against his genetics. The limitations of his pig genes kept coming up, and he kept overcoming them. Reynolds did a great job of getting me into his (pig) skin.</p><p>This book also has really good pacing. I was hooked throughout, and I don't remember any time being confused, unlike while reading the first two books. In earlier books, particularly Revelation Space, characters would often learn ground-breaking news but the reader wouldn't be told what it was until way later. In this installment, the different timelines end in cliffhangers but then continue right from the cliffhanger when the story picks back up. This kept me interested without making me feel confused and/or deprived.</p><p>Okay. Now about that ending. There I was, enjoying the story, excited to find out what happens. The book was cruising along at a good, fun 60mph. Then it went up to 100mph as the climax approached. And then—BAM!—suddenly the story slammed into a wall. And. Just. Died. Basically, somehow, Scorpio knew that the Shadows were a bad idea. This completely unknown and unseen alien race was watching the humans take a test, would they invite the Shadows in or not? How did Scorpio know this? No idea. So the humans pass this non-test and leave the Shadows in their dimension. Cool. Now what? Well, the Inhibitors keep hunting down humans. The humans keep trying to outrun them. The green star eater thingies start spreading and the Inhibitors mostly leave humanity alone... So it turns out that all this hype about the Inhibitors collapsed down into the Inhibitors not being defeated and eventually not even really being a problem. The book ends by telling the reader that everything they'd thought mattered actually didn't. Everything the characters had done could've been avoided and they could've just gone on their merry way, saving people and outrunning the Inhibitors because it turns out there are way, way bigger problems out there. So why was the story even about the Inhibitors instead of the bigger badder guys??</p><p>*sigh* 3/5 stars. It would've been a five, easily, if not for the way everything wrapped up.</p>
