                    One line review: Murderbot is an antisocial, depressed
                    security robot who hates its job and wants nothing more than
                    to watch TV shows, but unfortunately it is contractually
                    obliged to save its humans.

                    All Systems Red is funny, interesting and fun to read the
                    whole way through. It’s a story about a security robot named
                    Murderbot who hacked its own operating system and is now a
                    free agent. It doesn’t tell anyone this and instead uses its
                    newfound privileges to download thousands of hours of TV
                    shows. It is rented out to a team of researchers who are
                    exploring a new planet, and it pretty quickly turns out that
                    the team is in danger. Unfortunately for Murderbot that
                    means it has to stop watching TV shows and save its humans.

                    The story itself is pretty bland, especially if you’re
                    expecting an intricately plotted space opera, but that
                    doesn’t detract much from the enjoyment because the point of
                    the story is to get us invested in the plight of this robot
                    who has freedom and now has to figure out what to do with
                    that freedom. The world building is pretty sparse, aside
                    from some good descriptions of the planet. This too makes
                    sense. After all, Murderbot doesn’t care about what the
                    place looks like, and we’re seeing and hearing everything
                    from its perspective. Same goes for the humans in the story.
                    Murderbot didn’t care much whether they lived or died for at
                    least the beginning of the book, so why would it try to make
                    you care very much or even be able to tell the characters
                    apart?

                    The sentence fragments and otherwise informal writing style
                    took me a while to get used to, but it fits Murderbot’s
                    character so I can just assume the style was intentional.
                    This book is a funny and unique sci-fi novella from a
                    robot’s perspective. There’s nothing not to like. I’m super
                    excited to get into the rest of the series.
